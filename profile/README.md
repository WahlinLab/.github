## Welcome to WahlinLab

Located in La Jolla, California at UC San Diego, our lab specializes in growing **human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs)** as **3D retinal organoids** or as dissociated 2D monolayers to investigate the biology of the **developing retina *in vitro***. Using gene editing techniques (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9) we are exploring the fundamental biology of the retina by engineering cells to express **cell-type specific fluorescent protein reporters**. We study them from the first neural retina cells to the final stages of differentiation. It is hoped that this information will lead to the potential application as a transplantable source of tissue, a model for eye development and a system to develop “disease-in-a-dish” models for retinal degenerative disease.
